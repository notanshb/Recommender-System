student expected carried student ’ convenience via assignment term project assignment primarily meant student learn implementation skill design hand term project meant student explore problem and/or solution reading carry new design implement well assignment term project require student work team set developmental experimental platform conduct performance study implementation term project also require student articulate solution result interaction instructor design implementation document 4 Evaluation 4.
