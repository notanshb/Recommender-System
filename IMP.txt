---Processing the user-inputted query:---

File: app.py
Description: The main application file app.py is where the user's query is initially taken as input. This file acts as the entry point to the system, orchestrating the flow of data through other components.

---Processing the course description database:---

File: Likely to be part of the recommendation_engine.py or a separate utility module that the recommendation engine imports.
Description: The course description database processing occurs in the part of the system where course data needs to be normalized and prepared for comparison with user queries. This could involve tokenizing, removing stop words, and possibly lemmatizing the course descriptions to ensure they're in a consistent format for analysis.

---Extracting keywords from the job description database:---

File: learning_engine.py
Description: The learning_engine.py file is responsible for learning and extracting relevant skills or keywords from the job description database. This module might use techniques like TF-IDF to identify significant terms within the job descriptions.

---Enhancing the processed user query using the job description keywords:---

File: learning_engine.py
Description: After extracting keywords from the job description database, the learning_engine.py file would also be responsible for enhancing the user's query with these keywords. This could involve augmenting the query with relevant skills extracted in the previous step to make the query more comprehensive.

---Calculating the similarity between courses and the finally processed query:---

File: recommendation_engine.py
Description: The similarity between the processed course descriptions and the enhanced user query is calculated in the recommendation_engine.py file. This module could use content-based filtering techniques, such as cosine similarity, to determine how closely each course matches the user's interests based on the processed query.

---Outputting the recommended courses:---

File: app.py
Description: Finally, the list of recommended courses, determined by the recommendation_engine.py, is returned to the app.py file, where it is presented to the user. The app.py script handles user interaction, including displaying the final course recommendations.
